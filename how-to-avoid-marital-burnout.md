[Marriage](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/marriage "Psychology Today looks at Marriage") is a blessed covenant, designed to last a lifetime. A trip down the aisle should end with a loving walk into the sunset after a full life of love and [happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness "Psychology Today looks at happiness"). Yet although many couples are able to maintain a happy marriage, others are not. What is the difference, and how can spouses improve their chances of staying together? Research has some answers.

## Keep Marriage Sizzling Through Relational Satisfaction, Not Stress

Seeking to investigate the cause of marital [burnout](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout "Psychology Today looks at burnout"), Melike Kocyigit and Mehmet Uzun (2025) explored the process of [emotional regulation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotion-regulation "Psychology Today looks at emotional regulation") within marriage.\[i\] They begin by acknowledging the link between emotional well-being, [emotion](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/emotions "Psychology Today looks at emotion") regulation, and couple burnout. As many partners recognize instinctively, [stress](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress "Psychology Today looks at stress") can make it difficult to freely express emotion.

Kocyigit and Uzun note that [authenticity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/authenticity "Psychology Today looks at authenticity"), defined as exhibiting one’s “true” self, is necessary for couples to recognize and express emotion and decrease stress and conflict in a relationship. Studying 602 married individuals, they found, among other things, a combined moderating effect of relational authenticity and having children on the relationship between difficulty regulating emotion and spousal burnout. 

Thankfully, burnout can be both predictable and preventable.

## Behaviors That Buffer Burnout

Kocyigit and Uzun identify one of the most significant factors impacting couples’ emotional well-being as the link between emotional regulation and burnout—where they describe burnout as “a state of physical, emotional, and mental tiredness caused by continuous gaps between expectations and realities.” They note that couple burnout, which is often linked to factors including personal and professional challenges (such as [career](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/career "Psychology Today looks at career") hurdles) and increased stress, occurs gradually over time in response to life obstacles and unreasonable expectations. They describe the process of increasing negativity, noting that couples experience indifference and discouragement, followed by resentment, [anger](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger "Psychology Today looks at anger"), and frustration, which ultimately reduces the ability to experience compassion and sincerity. 

Over time, Kocyigit and Uzun note that couples may suffer physical burnout in the form of symptoms such as overeating, abdominal pain, and chronic headaches. In addition, they may experience emotional burnout in the form of negative emotions, diminished [self-esteem](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-esteem "Psychology Today looks at self-esteem"), and frustration with one’s partner. Finally, the researchers even acknowledge the possibility that mental burnout can manifest through feelings of sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, and [depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression "Psychology Today looks at depression"). Within such downward spirals, partners may exhibit disinterest and [anxiety](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety "Psychology Today looks at anxiety") about the future of the relationship, which can result in its dissolution. 

## Authenticity Is Positivity

Thankfully, there is good news. Kocyigit and Uzun note that because emotions impact the dynamics of [romantic relationships](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/relationships "Psychology Today looks at romantic relationships"), couples who are able to work together to regulate and negotiate their emotions can improve relational quality and reduce the chance of burnout.

In addition, Kocyigit and Uzun state that the relationship between authenticity and relationship satisfaction impacts a couple’s ability to avoid burnout. They note that authenticity is inversely linked with negative states such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and positively associated with psychological well-being. People with high levels of authenticity often trust their partners more and are more disposed to [attachment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment "Psychology Today looks at attachment"). 

Kocyigit and Uzun also note what most people have experienced personally: Authenticity is related to positive emotions and activities. Research linking authenticity with trust, self-disclosure, and relational harmony suggests that authentic individuals are able to share emotions more easily with their partners, allowing them to use functional strategies of regulating emotion to prevent burnout. In addition, because authenticity has been identified as a predictor of anger and aggressive attitudes (citing Pinto et al., 2012), they even suggest that partners who are authentic may be able to avoid anger and aggressive behavior because they can express their emotions easier. This can help them avoid engaging in relational behavior that can cause burnout.
